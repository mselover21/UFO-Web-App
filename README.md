# UFO Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to create a web application using Javascript to filter through UFO data. The goal was to familiarize myself with the Javascript language and allow users who are not to be able to easily sort through the data usining specific parameters. I was taked with adding several more search criteria including city, state, country and shape. To do this I used utilized the code within the modules and tweaked it slightly to add the new search areas in the index.html file. This project with help user search through the data easier and more specific in a very short amount of time.

### Results
The web application is very user friendly as it follows several of the the same things other websites utilize. When a user first opens the website they will notice the title of the website and a brief paragraph outlineing the purpose of the web app.
