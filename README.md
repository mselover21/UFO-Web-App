# UFO Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to create a web application using Javascript to filter through UFO data. The goal was to familiarize myself with the Javascript language and allow users who are not to be able to easily sort through the data usining specific parameters. I was taked with adding several more search criteria including city, state, country and shape. To do this I used utilized the code within the modules and tweaked it slightly to add the new search areas in the index.html file. This project with help user search through the data easier and more specific in a very short amount of time.

### Results
The web application is very user friendly as it follows several of the the same things other websites utilize. When a user first opens the website they will notice the title of the website and a brief paragraph outlineing the purpose of the web app.

Below that a user will notice on the lefthand side of the screen there is a container labeled "Filter Search" with the five filter criteria. To the right of that container there is where the data table lives. To filter the table all a user needs to do is enter any one or multiple of the filter criteria and click away from the text entry box. The table will automatically filter from the criteria that a user inputs.

After filters are entered the table will automatically update the results on the table based on the criteria entered. The image below shows when a user enters both a date and state criteria and updates the table with one result that matches.

Finally to reset the results of the table all a user has to do is click the UFO Sightings link in the top left corner of the webpage that is seen in the first image. This will clear all filters and allow the user to input new criteria to search for different results.

#### Summary
All in all the web application that I have created is very useful for an average user and easily filter through the data. The main drawback that I have is that filter inputs require a user to know to click away from the text input box to filter the table. I feel that to make it easier for an average user re-adding a "Filter Results" button will help accomodate less knowledgeable users. I also would add a "Reset Results" button next to the search criteria. Again having the reset capability is useful however, it is less intuitive for less experienced users and would be beneficial for all users. In summary this is a very great start in the development of a web application and with a little more development could be an amazing tool for users.
